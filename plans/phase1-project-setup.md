## Overview
Initial project setup establishing the foundation for the Go Tournament Manager application with a beautiful terminal UI using Bubbletea.

## Goals
- Set up Go project structure
- Install and configure TUI dependencies
- Create initial tournament selection screen
- Establish basic navigation and UI patterns

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Go Module Initialization ✅
- Created `go-tournament` module
- Set up `go.mod` and `go.sum`
- Configured Go 1.24.0+ requirement

### 2. Dependency Installation ✅
- **Bubbletea v1.3.9** - TUI framework
- **Lipgloss** - Terminal styling and layout
- All transitive dependencies installed

### 3. Tournament Selection Screen ✅
- Card-based UI for tournament type selection

  - Border: `#874BFD` (purple)
  - Selected border: `#FF69B4` (pink)
  - Header: `#FF6B6B` (red)
  - Help text: `#626262` (gray)
- Card-based layout with rounded borders
- Centered content with proper spacing

### 6. Documentation ✅
- Created comprehensive README.md
- Installation instructions
- Usage guide
- Controls documentation

## Deliverables

### Files Created
```

├── main.go          # Main application with menu screen
├── go.mod           # Go module definition
├── go.sum           # Dependency checksums
└── README.md        # Project documentation
```

### Key Features
- ✅ Working application that can be run with `go run main.go`
- ✅ Beautiful card-based tournament selection interface
- ✅ Keyboard navigation
- ✅ Alt screen mode for clean TUI experience
- ✅ Proper window size handling

## Technical Details

### Main Components
**Model Structure:**
```go
type model struct {
    tournaments []tournamentType
    selected    int
    width       int
    height      int
}
```

**Bubbletea Methods:**
- `Init()` - Initialize the model
- `Update()` - Handle messages (keyboard, window resize)
- `View()` - Render the UI

**Styling:**
- Used Lipgloss for all styling
- Responsive layout with `lipgloss.Place()`
- Dynamic card rendering based on selection state

## Lessons Learned
- Bubbletea's Elm Architecture provides clean separation of concerns
- Lipgloss makes terminal styling straightforward and maintainable
- Alt screen mode (`tea.WithAltScreen()`) is essential for professional TUI apps

## Next Steps
→ **Phase 2:** Application Structure Refactoring
- Separate menu into its own module
- Implement screen state management
- Create tournament package structure
